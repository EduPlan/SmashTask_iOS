## SmashTask

### App Description
A time management and study tool app for STEM majors on iOS. This task scheduler will use the student's class or life schedule to predict the perfect times to study and work on assignments. The scheduler will recommend these optimal times at the user's discretion. Additionally, the app may store photos of notes taken by the user and make them easily accessible during scheduled study times.

### App Idea Evaluation
- Mobile: This experience would also work well as a PC version, but the mobile app provides convenience.
- Story: Make it a habit to complete your assignments by the deadline and manage your study time more effectively.
- Market: In my experience as a student, I find that time management is always a highly sought after skill by peers.
- Habit: The hope is that the organization this app provides will make it an indispensible tool for students.
- Scope: I feel that an MVP of this application is highly viable to produce given 10 weeks to complete.
