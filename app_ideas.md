  - **Scope:** The scope required to build all of these products or even one individually would be immense.
  
## New App Ideas - List
1. Learn Data Science
  - A app similar to many on the market that teach programming languages such as Python, though it will teach users basic to intermediate
  Data Science techniques using Pandas, Numpy, and SciPy. The application will feature lessons and guided activities that put Data Science
  tools into practice with simple but realistic and practical datasets.
2. Physics Flashcards
  - Create flashcards for college level Physics formulas and save them along with a description of the formula and the section that
  it appears in. Users can use a special scientific keyboard to input formulas and save them along with link to other derivations
  of the formula. Store all of your Physics reference in one place! For the student and the professional.
3. Pair Programmer
  - Use an online matchmaking system to pair together two programmers of equal skill level to work together to solve a programming
  problems. This tool can be used to simulate remote technical interviews and practical collaboration skills. User's may create a
  list of friends with whom to practice with and even challenge other users to a speed and space test given a problem statement.
4. Study Time Management
  - An app tailored torwards STEM students, this task scheduler will use the student's class or life schedule to predict the perfect times
  to study and work on assignments. The scheduler will recommend these optimal times at the user's discretion. Additionally, the app may
  store photos of notes taken by the user and make them easily accessible during scheduled study times.
5. Calculus Flashcards
  - Create flashcards for college level Pre-Algebra-Calculus formulas and save them along with descriptions or definitions of the
  formula and the section where it appears. Users can use a special mathematics keyboard to input formulas and save them along with
  links to other forumalas in the same section. Store all of your Calculus reference in one place! for students and professionals.
6. Algorithm Visualizer
  - Uses GUI elements to visualize the most popular Computer Science algorithms, while also providing descriptions and code snippets
  in various languages. Additional low-level programming, discrete structures, and logic design topics may also be included along with
  visualizations. These will involve animations of the algorithms in progress.
